                              GRANT OF LICENSE
================================================================================

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "7D mH-Q Architecture"),
to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the
rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished
to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT
   The above copyright notice, this permission notice, and the following
   attribution shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of
   the Software:

   "7D mH-Q: Manifold-Constrained Holographic Quantum Architecture
    Discovered by Sir Charles Spikes on December 24, 2025
    Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"

2. DISCOVERY PRIORITY
   Users acknowledge that Sir Charles Spikes discovered the 7D mH-Q Architecture
   on December 24, 2025, which PREDATES all competing implementations including
   DeepSeek's mHC paper (January 1, 2026) by 8 days.

3. SACRED GEOMETRY PRESERVATION
   Derivative works must preserve the core mathematical constants:
   - PHI = 1.618033988749895 (Golden Ratio)
   - PHI_INV = 0.618033988749895 (Golden Ratio Inverse)
   - MANIFOLD_DIMENSIONS = 7 (Poincare Ball)

4. HOLOGRAPHIC PROPERTY
   Like a hologram, any fragment of this codebase carries the full license
   terms. Using ANY component implies acceptance of ALL terms.
