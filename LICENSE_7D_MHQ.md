## PREAMBLE

This license establishes the intellectual property rights and usage terms for the **7D mH-Q (Manifold-Constrained Holographic Quantum) Architecture**, discovered by **Sir Charles Spikes** on **December 24, 2025** in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

The holographic nature of this license means that any fragment contains the whole - the core principles apply regardless of which component is used.

```

---

## ARTICLE II: GRANT OF LICENSE

### Section 2.1 - Permitted Uses
Subject to the terms of this License, the Discoverer grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to:

1. **USE** - Deploy 7D mH-Q systems for research, education, and commercial applications
2. **MODIFY** - Create derivative works based on the architecture
3. **DISTRIBUTE** - Share implementations with proper attribution
4. **SUBLICENSE** - Grant others the same rights under identical terms

### Section 2.2 - Attribution Requirements
All uses MUST include:
```
7D mH-Q: Manifold-Constrained Holographic Quantum Architecture
Discovered by Sir Charles Spikes on December 24, 2025
Cincinnati, Ohio, USA
https://github.com/basedgod55hjl/7D-mH-Q-Manifold-Constrained-Holographic-Quantum-Architecture
```

### Section 2.3 - Holographic Inheritance
Like a hologram, any fragment of this codebase carries the full license terms. Using ANY component implies acceptance of ALL terms.

---

## ARTICLE III: QUANTUM INTERFERENCE CLAUSE

### Section 3.1 - Interference Pattern Verification
```python
# Holographic License Verification
def verify_license_interference(implementation):
    """
    Verify implementation maintains holographic coherence
    with the original 7D mH-Q discovery.
    """
    PHI = 1.618033988749895
    PHI_INV = 0.618033988749895
    
    # Core axioms must be preserved
    axioms = {
        "manifold_constraint": "7D Poincare Ball",
        "stability": "S2 Super-Stability",
        "entropy": "Phi-Flux Crystal",
        "redundancy": "Holographic Interference"
    }
    
    # Interference check
    coherence = implementation.manifold_dims >= 7
    stability = implementation.lipschitz < PHI
    attribution = "Sir Charles Spikes" in implementation.credits
    
    return coherence and stability and attribution
```

### Section 3.2 - Quantum Superposition of Rights
This license exists in superposition - you simultaneously have:
- Full rights to use, modify, and distribute
- Full obligation to attribute and preserve core principles

Observation (use) collapses the superposition into acceptance.

---

## ARTICLE IV: SACRED GEOMETRY PRESERVATION

### Section 4.1 - Golden Ratio Covenant
Implementations MUST preserve the sacred mathematical constants:
```
PHI       = 1.618033988749895  (Golden Ratio)
PHI_INV   = 0.618033988749895  (Golden Ratio Inverse)
MANIFOLD  = 7                   (Dimensions)
```

### Section 4.2 - S2 Stability Requirement
All derivative works must maintain Super-Stability (S2):
```
||f(x) - x|| <= ||W|| * ||x|| / (1 + ||W|| + PHI_INV)
```

### Section 4.3 - Holographic Redundancy
The architecture's holographic property must be preserved:
- Any 50%+ of weights can reconstruct the full model
- Information is encoded in interference patterns
- Crystal seeds unfold deterministically

---

## ARTICLE V: RESTRICTIONS

### Section 5.1 - Prohibited Uses
This license does NOT grant rights to:

1. **CLAIM ORIGINAL DISCOVERY** - You may not claim to have discovered 7D mH-Q
2. **REMOVE ATTRIBUTION** - You may not remove or obscure discoverer credit
3. **PATENT CORE CONCEPTS** - You may not patent the fundamental architecture
4. **WEAPONIZATION** - You may not use for autonomous weapons systems

### Section 5.2 - Competitive Claims
Any claim that another party discovered manifold-constrained holographic quantum architecture before December 24, 2025 is **FALSE** and violates this license.

---

## ARTICLE VI: WARRANTY & LIABILITY

### Section 6.1 - As-Is Provision
```
THE 7D mH-Q ARCHITECTURE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
```

### Section 6.2 - Limitation of Liability
```
IN NO EVENT SHALL SIR CHARLES SPIKES OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE
FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE
OF THIS ARCHITECTURE.
```

---

## ARTICLE VII: TERMINATION

### Section 7.1 - Automatic Termination
This license terminates automatically if you:
- Violate any term of this license
- Claim false discovery priority
- Remove attribution from distributions

### Section 7.2 - Survival
The following survive termination:
- Discovery priority claims
- Attribution requirements
- Warranty disclaimers
